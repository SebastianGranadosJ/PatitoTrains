# 🚆 Passenger Train Management System

This project is a system developed in **Java** to manage passenger trains.  
It uses **JavaFX** for user interfaces, **RMI** for server-client communication, implements custom data structures, and uses **JSON** as a database to manage information.

## ✨ Features

- **Modules:**
  - 🖥️ **Centralized Server:** Manages communication between modules and clients.
  - ⚙️ **Administration Module:** Manage trains, routes, and schedules.
  - 🎟️ **Ticket Management Module:** Purchase and manage passenger tickets.
  - 🚉 **Boarding Module:** Handle passenger boarding processes.

- **Graphs and Algorithms:**
  - 🗺️ Graphs represent train routes.
  - 📐 Algorithms to calculate the shortest route regardless of the passenger's location.

- **Technologies used:**
  - 🎨 **JavaFX:** User interfaces.
  - 🌐 **RMI:** Client-server communication.
  - 📂 **JSON:** Database to store and manage information.
